# Little Pont

This project was designed for Milestone Project 4 of Code Institutes' Level 5 Diploma in Web Development.

Little Pont is fantastic new business that is about to launch in the village of Ponteland, Northumberland. 
A lack in services for young children and families in the village of Ponteland, led a group of enthusiastic mothers (all with early years and/or teaching experience) to get together and start this exciting new venture. 

Little Pont is a child-sized village that has been modelled upon the actual village of Ponteland so that the businesses and buildings are familiar to the children. Here, children can can learn about the different business in their communities, and how the various services and businesses help to keep the the village vibrant! 
This role play environemnt promotes hands-on experiential learning for children to learn how people live and work together. Children will have the opportunity to role play different occupations and practice everyday life skills.

Little Pont also teaches Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in each session. Each Class has an exciting, practical STEM learning activity taught by one of our fantastic team,and designed to be age-specific to the group. Classes are booked based upon the age of the child but siblings are welcome to come along and get involved as well! Little Pont is family and community-orientated and its ethos is to provide a safe, fun and educational place for children and families to come together within their community to learn, play and socialise together. 

The Little Pont team are looking to launch their business with the aid of a brand new website. Ponteland and its surrounding areas are highly affluent, and they want the website to appeal to this local community. The website must be easy to access and simple to use. It needs to look professional and aesthetic but also fun and playful. 

This website has been built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python.

All templates within these apps are extended from a base template. The base template comprises of the navigation bar and footer. Below is a breakdown of the main site deatures.

       [Navigation Bar - desktop](documentation/readme/images/nav_bar_desktop.png)

       * The responsive navbar features a hamburger menu on medium sized devices and smaller. This displays the Home, About, Courses and Contact dropdown/links.

    *  I had planned on adding a Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs) section to add more information to the site in a user friendly and succinct way. This would be different to how the rest of the site information is presented. I feel that this would have increased user satisfaction. 
    * In the future I would like to add Booking/Contact/Enquiry Form links directly from their social media accounts as i think a lot of the site users/parents would find out about our business via their socials.

## Deployment

-   ### Version Control

To deploy Take A Hike to Heroku, take the following steps:
1. Create a requirements.txt file using the terminal command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
2. Create a Procfile with the terminal command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`. Ensure you use a capital 'P' for this file.
3. `git add` and `git commit` these changes and `git push` to GitHub repository
4. Go to the Heroku website and login. Create a new app by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard.
5. Give the app and name and set the region to Europe(or your closest region)
6. From the heroku dashboard of the new app, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select Github
7. Confirm the link to the correct GitHub repository
8. In the heroku dashboard for the application. click on the "settings" > "Reveal Config Vars"
9. Set the following Config Vars:

|   | Key            | Value          |   |
|---|----------------|----------------|---|
|   | DB_URL         |     |   |
|   | IP             |       |   |
|   | PORT           |            |   |
|   | SECRET_KEY     |    |   |

(this is an example, actual env variable not disclosed to maintain security. To get the db url follow [CI PosgreSQL]())

10. In the Heroku dashboard, click "Deploy"
11. In the "Manual Deployment" section, ensure the master branch is selected then click "Deploy Branch"
11. The site is now deployed
12. To connect to the database click the more button on the Heroku dashboard and select run console.
13. Type python3 and once the interpreter opens, run the following:
```bash
from ... import db
db.create_all()
exit()
```

- [Sugarloaf and a Cup of Joe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UidskJk0KiE&t=611s) assisted with adding a datepicker within the crispy form by using the simple forms dateinut function and adding this within the view. It renders a datepicker calendar within the start and end date inputs within the Add a Course form. I also needed to add a time picker to make choosing a time easier for the admin. [Django Project](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/need-help-with-date-time-picker/16988) was helpful in adding the TimeInput function to the form.
