# Little Pont

This project was designed for Milestone Project 4 of Code Institutes' Level 5 Diploma in Web Development.

Little Pont is fantastic new business that is about to launch in the village of Ponteland, Northumberland. 
A lack in services for young children and families in the village of Ponteland, led a group of enthusiastic mothers (all with early years and/or teaching experience) to get together and start this exciting new venture. 

Little Pont is a child-sized village that has been modelled upon the actual village of Ponteland so that the businesses and buildings are familiar to the children. Here, children can can learn about the different business in their communities, and how the various services and businesses help to keep the the village vibrant! 
This role play environemnt promotes hands-on experiential learning for children to learn how people live and work together. Children will have the opportunity to role play different occupations and practice everyday life skills.

Little Pont also teaches Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in each session. Each Class has an exciting, practical STEM learning activity taught by one of our fantastic team,and designed to be age-specific to the group. Classes are booked based upon the age of the child but siblings are welcome to come along and get involved as well! Little Pont is family and community-orientated and its ethos is to provide a safe, fun and educational place for children and families to come together within their community to learn, play and socialise together. 

The Little Pont team are looking to launch their business with the aid of a brand new website. Ponteland and its surrounding areas are highly affluent, and they want the website to appeal to this local community. The website must be easy to access and simple to use. It needs to look professional and aesthetic but also fun and playful. 

This website has been built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python.

## Design

-   ### Colour Scheme

    * [Coolors](see [Credits](#credits) for attribution) was used to find a colour palette. The site design needed to be welcoming, colourful and whimsical without being too harsh visually. For this reason a pastel colour palette was chosen as the colours compliment each other whilst having a gentle softness. As the site has elements throughout its pages where the pastels are used, alongside images to create interest, it was decided that in order to maintain a light and bright feel and not overpower the user, to have the background colour of the site as a white or off white. This maintains a professional clean feel to the site overall.

    [Colour Palette](documentation/readme/images/colour_palette.png)

-   ### Typography

    * From Google Fonts, 'Amatic SC' was chosen for the sites titles. A simple hand-drawn effect, is is playful yet it is very clear and legible. The site is designed to be fun and this suits this design perfectly. The rest of the sites font is 'Roboto', chosen as it is also a simple, clear and open font but without the sharp edges of other font types. The curves on the font fit in with the curves created by the borders on the site and feels warmer, friendlier and less strict.

    [Font](documentation/readme/images/colour_palette.png)

-   ### Imagery

    * Images were predominently taken from Freepix (see [Credits](#credits) for attribution). A mixture of photos and cartoons were used as it was felt this would be appealing to the site purpose and immediately support the sites purpose.
    * The main site header uses a fun and colourful 'sky and cloud' background to compliment the site logo. The site logo was designed using Canva(see [Credits](#credits) for attribution). Little Pont is a role play town and the logo reflect this. It consists of a colourful cartoon town against a circular white background which displays the site title.

-   ### Features For Future Implementation
    *  I had planned on adding a Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs) section to add more information to the site in a user friendly and succinct way. This would be different to how the rest of the site information is presented. I feel that this would have increased user satisfaction. 
    * In the future I would like to add Booking/Contact/Enquiry Form links directly from their social media accounts as i think a lot of the site users/parents would find out about our business via their socials.
    * A potential future feature would be to create a new app to incorporate the cafe aspect of the business, and to allow pre-ordering of food. This would help support the business as Little Pont would be able to prepare stock and reduce wastage.

## Deployment

-   ### Version Control

This website was created using the CI full template (https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template)

#### Database creation

To create the database:
1. Navigate to the CI Database Maker(https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/) which creates a new PostgreSQL database.
2. Type in your email address into the input field as directed and click submit
3. You will recieve an email with the new PostgreSQL instance. Keep these details safe, they will be used shortly.

#### Heroku
To deploy Little Pont to Heroku, take the following steps:
1. Create a requirements.txt file using the terminal command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
2. Create a Procfile with the terminal command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`. Ensure you use a capital 'P' for this file.
3. `git add` and `git commit` these changes and `git push` to GitHub repository
4. Go to the Heroku website and login. Create a new app by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard.
5. Give the app and name and set the region to Europe(or your closest region)
6. From the heroku dashboard of the new app, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select Github
7. Confirm the link to the correct GitHub repository
8. In the heroku dashboard for the application. click on the "settings" > "Reveal Config Vars"
9. Ensure these config vars in the final setup:

| Key                   | Value             |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     | 'AWS_ID'          |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | 'AWS_SECRET'      |
| DATABASE_URL          | 'DB_URL'          |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD   | 'EMAIL_HOST_PASS' |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER       | 'EMAIL_HOST_USER' |
| SECRET_KEY            | 'SECRET_KEY'      |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY     | 'STRIPE_PUBLIC'   |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY     | 'STRIPE_SECRET'   |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET      | 'WH_SECRET'       |
| USE_AWS               | True              |

(this is an example, actual env variable not disclosed to maintain security. To get the db url follow [CI PosgreSQL]())

10. In the Heroku dashboard, click "Deploy"
11. In the "Manual Deployment" section, ensure the main branch is selected then click "Deploy Branch"


#### Connect new DB to Heroku app
1. In the terminal, install dj_database_url and psycopg2, both of these are needed to connect to your external database.

2. pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
3. Update your requirements.txt file with the newly installed packages

4. pip freeze > requirements.txt
5. In your settings.py file, import dj_database_url underneath the import for os
```
 import os
 import dj_database_url
```
6. Scroll to the DATABASES section and update it to the following code, so that the original connection to sqlite3 is commented out and we connect to the new database instead. Paste in the database URL from your PostgreSQL from Code Institute email as below (do not commit these changes)
```
#DATABASES = {
#     'default': {
#          'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
#          'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
#      }
#  }
     
 DATABASES = {
     'default': dj_database_url.parse('your-database-url-here')
 }
``` 
7. In the terminal, run the showmigrations command to confirm you are connected to the external database
```
python3 manage.py showmigrations
```
you should see a list of all migrations
8. Migrate your database models to your new database
```
 python3 manage.py migrate
```
9. Create a superuser- follow the stps after entering the following command
```
 python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
10. Revert changes made in step 8.
11. Update cose in settings.py as follows:
```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```
12. Install gunicorn and add to requirements:
```
pip3 install gunicorn
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
13. Within the Procfile add `web: gunicorn app-name.wsgi:application` (add app name where indicated), this tells Heroku to create a web dyno and serve our django app.
14. Go to local CLI and login to Heroku using `heroku login -i` and enter heroku login details (email and password from Required Authenitcations within the Applications section). 
15. temporarily disable collect static. This tells Heroku not to collect static files when we deploy:
```
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app heroku-app-name-here
```
16. Add the Heroku app and localhost (which will allow GitPod to still work) to ALLOWED_HOSTS = [] in settings.py:
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['heroku deployed site URL here', 'localhost' ]
```

17. Initialise Heroku git remote to app by typing the following command:
```
heroku git:remote -a <name_of_your_app>
```
18. Then push to heroku
```
git push heroku
```
19. Save, add, commit and push the changes to GitHub. You can then also initialize the Heroku git remote in the terminal and push to Heroku with:
```
heroku git:remote -a {app name here}
git push heroku main
```
You should now be able to see the deployed site (without any static files as we haven't set these up yet).
20. Set app up to automatically deploy when we push to github. Go to Heroku and click 'Depoly' tab. Click Github option and search for github repo in input field. Once found, click connect. Now click 'Enable autmatic deploys'
21. Generate a Django secret key using a secret key generator. Add this in config vars in Heroku.
22. Add changes to settings.py:
```
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
```

#### Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Setup instructions taken from CI.
Next, set up AWS which is used to host the sites static and media files as Heroku is unable to host them.

##### Create an S3 Bucket
1. Create account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. Login using Root to access the AWS console.
3. Search for and select 'S3'.
4. Click 'Create Bucket'.
5. Type in a bucket name and select closest region to you.
6. Enter a bucket name (this should relate to your Heroku app name), and select the region closest to you
7. Uncheck 'Block all public access' and acknowledge that the bucket will be public, click 'ACLs enabled' and 'Bucket owner preferred', click 'Create bucket'
8. Click the bucket instance you just created and navigate to the Properties tab
9. Scroll down to 'static website hosting' and click 'use this bucket to host a website'
10. Enter default values of index.HTML for the Index document, and error.HTML for the Error document then click 'Save'
11. On the Permissions tab paste the following code into the CORS configuration editor and then click 'Save': 
    ```
    [
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Authorization"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
    ]
    ```
12. For the Access control list (ACL) section, click edit and enable List for Everyone (public access) and
accept the warning box. If the edit button is disabled, you need to change the Object Ownership
section above to ACLs enabled.
13. In the services tab navigate to IAM(Identify and Access Management). Click User Group and then Create Group. Follow the instructions to create the group.
14. Create an S3 bucket Policy and add it. Copy the ARN from the Amazon resource tab and paste into the bucket policy where directed. To attach the policy, on the sidebar, click User Groups. Select your group, go to the permissions
tab, open the Add permissions dropdown, and click Attach policies. Select the policy and click add permissions at the bottom.
15. Copy the policy and paste it into the bucket policy editor and add '/*' to the end of the resourse ARN to allow access to all resources in the bucket, it should look similar to this:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Policynumber",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1724847378401",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "*"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::chosen-name/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
16. Within the permissions tab, grant Public Access to 'Everyone'
17. Next, to retrieve the access key go to IAM and select 'Users'
18. Select the user for whom you wish to create a CSV file.
19. Select the 'Security Credentials' tab
20. Scroll to 'Access Keys' and click 'Create access key'
21. Select 'Application running outside AWS', and click next
22. On the next screen, you can leave the 'Description tag value' blank. Click 'Create Access Key'
22. Click the 'Download .csv file' button

##### Connect Django and S3 bucket
1. Install boto3 and django storages and freeze them to the requirements.txt file.
```
pip3 install boto3
pip3 install django-storages
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
2. In settings.py add `'storages',` to installed apps
3. To use our bucket if we are using the deployed site, in settings.py add the following:
```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=9460800',
    }
    
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'enter your bucket name here'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'enter the region you selected here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
```
4. Update Heroku config vars(see Heroku deployment section), remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable.
5. Create a file called custom_storages.py in the root, add imports and custom classes. These will tell the app the location to store static and media files:
```
from django.conf import settings
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

6. To let the app know where to store static and media files, and to override the static and media URLs in production, add to settings.py: 
```
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```
7. Save, add, commit and push these changes to make a deployment to Heroku. In the build log you will see that the static files were collected, and in our S3 bucket we can see the static folder with all the static files in it.
8. Navigate to S3 and open the bucket. Create folder and name it 'media', to store all the media files for the site. Add media files for site by clicking upload and choosing the relevant files.

#### Correct settings.py configuration
1. Ensure the following final setup within the settings.py file looks like this:
```
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = (os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),)

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
     # Cache control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }
    
    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your-app-name'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your-local-region'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'

# Stripe
STRIPE_CURRENCY = 'gbp'
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')


if 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ:
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'your-default-email'
else:
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD')
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
```
