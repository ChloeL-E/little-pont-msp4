# Little Pont

This project was designed for Milestone Project 4 of Code Institutes' Level 5 Diploma in Web Development.

Little Pont is fantastic new business that is about to launch in the village of Ponteland, Northumberland. 
A lack in services for young children and families in the village of Ponteland, led a group of enthusiastic mothers (all with early years and/or teaching experience) to get together and start this exciting new venture. 

Little Pont is a child-sized village that has been modelled upon the actual village of Ponteland so that the businesses and buildings are familiar to the children. Here, children can can learn about the different business in their communities, and how the various services and businesses help to keep the the village vibrant! 
This role play environemnt promotes hands-on experiential learning for children to learn how people live and work together. Children will have the opportunity to role play different occupations and practice everyday life skills.

Little Pont also teaches Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in each session. Each Class has an exciting, practical STEM learning activity taught by one of our fantastic team,and designed to be age-specific to the group. Classes are booked based upon the age of the child but siblings are welcome to come along and get involved as well! Little Pont is family and community-orientated and its ethos is to provide a safe, fun and educational place for children and families to come together within their community to learn, play and socialise together. 

The Little Pont team are looking to launch their business with the aid of a brand new website. Ponteland and its surrounding areas are highly affluent, and they want the website to appeal to this local community. The website must be easy to access and simple to use. It needs to look professional and aesthetic but also fun and playful. 

This website has been built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python.

-   ### Database Schema
    * The database was designed using Lucid Chart(see credits). 
    * [EDR diagram](testing/images/ERD.png)
    * There are 7 tables within this relational database:  User, User Profile, Order, Order Line Item, Course, Instructor and Enquiry. Instructor has a one-to-many relationship with the Cuurse model. User Profile has a one-to-many relatiomship with Enquiry.

## Structure

There are 7 main apps within Little Pont: home, profiles, products, bag, checkout, instructor and contact which make up the full site. All templates within these apps are extended from a base template. The base template comprises of the navigation bar and footer. Below is a breakdown of the main site deatures.

-   ### Features 

    * Responsive on device sizes with media screen size >280px

-   ### Features used in every page:

    -   #### Favicon

    -   #### Navigation Bar

       [Navigation Bar - desktop]()

       * The responsive navbar features a hamburger menu on medium sized devices and smaller. This displays the Home, About, Courses and Contact dropdown/links. A bright and colourful site logo and header is included with each page. This is to catch the eye of the user and their children and entice them to use the business. The Account and Shopping Bag icons remain the same on all devices so they are easily accessible to the user.

       [Navigation Bar- mobile device ]()

       [Navigation Bar- mobile device- hamburger menu open]()
    
    -   #### Scroll Button
    
    -   #### Footer
        * Features the site Title, links to the Register/Login pages and social links.

        [Footer]()
        [Footer - mobile device]()

-   ### Features in main site pages:

    -   #### Hero Images

        * Each of the main site pages have a large hero image which gives the user a bit of information about what the page purpose is. Its purpose is also to add colour and interest to these pages to maintain interest.
    
    Main Content

    -   #### Home page
        * App: Home
        * This page has a large colourful hero image of a happy girl dressed uo as a chef. This will hopefully give the site user intstant information about the role play element of Little Pont and some idea of what to expect when visiting the business. The Home page comprises of header/navbar, hero image, footer and then two main information sections: About Us and What We Offer.
        
        [Home page]()
        [Home page- About Us]()
        [Home page- What We Offer]()

    -   #### My Profile page
        * 
    -   #### Courses page
    -   #### Courses detail pages
    -   #### Course Management page
    -   #### Instructor Info page
    -   #### Instructor Detail page
    -   #### Team Management page
    -   #### Shopping Bag page
    -   #### Checkout page
    -   #### Checkout Success page
    -   #### Enquiry Form page
    -   #### Register page
    -   #### Login page
    -   #### Logout page
    -   #### Forms


-   ### Features For Future Implementation
    *  I had planned on adding a Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs) section to add more information to the site in a user friendly and succinct way. This would be different to how the rest of the site information is presented. I feel that this would have increased user satisfaction. 
    * In the future I would like to add Booking/Contact/Enquiry Form links directly from their social media accounts as i think a lot of the site users/parents would find out about our business via their socials.

## Deployment

-   ### Version Control

To deploy Take A Hike to Heroku, take the following steps:
1. Create a requirements.txt file using the terminal command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
2. Create a Procfile with the terminal command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`. Ensure you use a capital 'P' for this file.
3. `git add` and `git commit` these changes and `git push` to GitHub repository
4. Go to the Heroku website and login. Create a new app by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard.
5. Give the app and name and set the region to Europe(or your closest region)
6. From the heroku dashboard of the new app, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select Github
7. Confirm the link to the correct GitHub repository
8. In the heroku dashboard for the application. click on the "settings" > "Reveal Config Vars"

- [Sugarloaf and a Cup of Joe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UidskJk0KiE&t=611s) assisted with adding a datepicker within the crispy form by using the simple forms dateinut function and adding this within the view. It renders a datepicker calendar within the start and end date inputs within the Add a Course form. I also needed to add a time picker to make choosing a time easier for the admin. [Django Project](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/need-help-with-date-time-picker/16988) was helpful in adding the TimeInput function to the form.
