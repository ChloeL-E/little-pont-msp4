                                    Little Pont is the first interactive role play center to open in the local area,
                                    run by dedicated instructors. A child-sized town, modelled upon the actual 
                                    village of Ponteland, means that the businesses and buildings are familiar to the children.
                                    Here, children can learn about the different business in their communities,
                                    and how theys help to keep the our town vibrant!
                                    Role play environments promote hands-on experiential learning for children 
                                    to learn how people live and work together.
                                    Children will have the opportunity to role play different
                                    occupations and practice everyday life skills in a little town
                                    that they recognise!</p>
