            <p>
              Little Pont is the first interactive role play center to open in the local area, run by dedicated
              instructors.
              A child-sized town modelled upon the actual village
              of Ponteland means that the businesses and buildings are familiar to the children.
              Here, children can learn about the different business in their communities,
              and how the various services and businesses help to keep the our town vibrant!
              Role play environments promote hands-on experiential
              learning for children to learn how people live and work together.
              Children will have the opportunity to role play different
              occupations and practice everyday life skills in a little town
              that they recognise!

              We have a passion for teaching children so we have integrated inspiring and interactive STEM workshops
              into each session. Each session is age-specific and so we are able to keep children engaged by creating
              age-appropriate workshops. And most importantly, it's so much fun!
